BioGlass is a Glass app used to read and visualize the data collected from
the Empatica and Q sensors. It includes (requires) the barcode scanner apk 
0.2.1 for Glass. This allows the user to scan the sensor QR codes that store
the MAC address of the device (and thus connect wirelessly to them)

BioGlass is based off (in order) Google's WaveformActivity sample code, and
Javier Hernandez-Rivera's original code to connect to the sensors.
