# BioGlass

BioGlass is a Glass app used to read and visualize the data collected from the Empatica and Q sensors. It includes (requires) the barcode scanner apk 0.2.1 for Glass. This allows the user to scan the sensor QR codes that stores the MAC address of the device, and connect wirelessly to them.

BioGlass is based off Google's WaveformActivity sample code, and Javier Hernandez Rivera's original code to connect to the sensors. 

It was part of the UROP Summer of 2013 project at the MIT Media Lab, under the supervision of Javier Hernandez Rivera. Thank you!
